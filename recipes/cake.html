        <h3>Description</h3>
        <p>This is a cake that's made with coconut. It should hopefully be good...
            hopefully. Yields 24 servings.</p>

        <h3>Ingredients</h3>
            <ul>
                <li>2 cups white sugar</li>
                <li>1 cup butter, softened</li>
                <li>4 eggs, separated</li>
                <li>1 cup unsweetened shredded coconut</li>
                <li>2 cups all-purpose flour</li>
                <li>2 tablespoons baking powder</li>
                <li>1 teaspoon salt</li>
                <li>1 (14 ounce) can coconut milk</li>


            </ul>

        <h3>Steps</h3>
        <ol>
            <li>Preheat oven to 350 degrees F (175 degrees C). Grease a 9x13-inch cake 
                pan.</li>
            <li>Beat sugar, butter, and egg yolks together in a bowl using an electric 
                mixer until smooth and creamy; add shredded coconut.</li>
            <li>Whisk flour, baking powder, and salt together in a bowl. Stir creamed 
                butter mixture, alternating with coconut milk, into flour mixture until 
                batter is just mixed.</li>
            <li>Beat egg whites in a glass or metal bowl until until soft peaks form. 
                Lift your beater or whisk straight up: the egg whites will form soft mounds 
                rather than a sharp peak. Fold egg whites into batter. Pour batter into 
                the prepared cake pan.</li>
            <li>Bake in the preheated oven until a toothpick inserted in the center 
                of the cake comes out clean, about 45 minutes.</li>

        </ol>
