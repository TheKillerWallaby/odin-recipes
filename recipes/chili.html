        <h3>Description</h3>
        <p>From Cincinnati! Home of the Bengals! Who would've thought they could 
            have made it to the Super Bowl! Not me! Yield 10 servings. </p>

        <h3>Ingredients</h3>
        <ul>
            <li>2 pounds lean ground beef</li>
            <li>1 quart water, or amount to cover</li>
            <li>2 onions, finely chopped</li>
            <li>1 (15 ounce) can tomato sauce</li>
            <li>2 tablespoons vinegar</li>
            <li>2 teaspoons Worcestershire sauce</li>
            <li>4 cloves garlic, minced</li>
            <li>½ (1 ounce) square unsweetened chocolate</li>
            <li>¼ cup chili powder</li>
            <li>1½ teaspoons salt</li>
            <li>1 teaspoon ground cumin</li>
            <li>1 teaspoon ground cinnamon</li>
            <li>½ teaspoon ground cayenne pepper</li>
            <li>5 whole cloves</li>
            <li>5 whole allspice berries</li>
            <li>1 bay leaf</li>
        </ul>

        <h3>Steps</h3>
        <ol>
            <li>Place the ground beef in a large pan, cover with about 1 quart of 
                cold water, and bring to a boil, stirring and breaking up the beef 
                with a fork to a fine texture. Slowly boil until the meat is 
                thoroughly cooked, about 30 minutes, then remove from heat and 
                refrigerate in the pan overnight.</li>
            <li>The next day, skim the solid fat from the top of the pan, and 
                discard the fat. Place the beef mixture over medium heat, and stir 
                in the onions, tomato sauce, vinegar, Worcestershire sauce, garlic, 
                chocolate, chili powder, salt, cumin, cinnamon, cayenne pepper, 
                cloves, allspice berries, and bay leaf. Bring to a boil, reduce heat 
                to a simmer, and cook, stirring occasionally, for 3 hours. Add water 
                if necessary to prevent the chili from burning.</li>
